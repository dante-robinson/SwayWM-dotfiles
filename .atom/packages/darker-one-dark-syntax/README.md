# darker-one-dark-syntax
This is just edited original [One Dark](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-syntax) syntax, but this syntax is made more **colorful** and **darker**.

## Original syntax comparsion
Try to compare the images when you open them in a new tab.

I recommend to use this syntax with original [one-dark UI theme](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-ui), it looks way better than the other built-in UI themes.

## Installation
**Via command line**
```
apm install darker-one-dark-syntax
```

**Via atom**

Go to **Settings > Install** and next to the search bar select **themes**, than search for `darker-one-dark-syntax`. And install it obviously.

After installing, go to **Settings > Themes > Syntax Themes** and select "darker-one-dark-syntax" from the drop-down menu.
